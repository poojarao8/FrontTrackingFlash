FrontTier Front Tracking Module
===============================

To enable the Front Tracking module, simply configure with:
	"--with-unit=FrontTracking"

Front Tracking also requires the simulation implement the function:
	Simulation_frontLevelFunc()

A stub can be found in the simulation directory. This is a level
function for a levelset initialization of the front. This function
takes in the arguments x,y,z and returns the signed distance to the
front. The sign indicates in which of two fluid components the point
resides.

The front propagation is a Lagrangian propagation of an unstructured
mesh representing the front which propagates based on the fluid
velocity interpolated to the front point.
